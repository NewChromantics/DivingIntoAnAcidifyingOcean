Hello!


Local Testing
============
- This is a simple static site, so it just needs to be deployed to a webserver.
- Run locally easily on OSX by opening a `terminal` and `cd`'ing to the directory with this repository and run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8001`
- Then just browse to `http://localhost:8001/`
